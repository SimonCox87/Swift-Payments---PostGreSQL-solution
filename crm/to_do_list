Tasks to complete

1.  Edit the columns found in the deals/customer table.  Make sure it matches that of spreadsheet.

2.  Check all tables to ensure that all relevant columns match those of the spreadsheet.  Once
    this has been done run the installation file again to update all tables on postGresSQL.

3.  Work on the Companies table.  Find out whether this is the table that contains the entries
    for each customer?  So a company might own more than one site/shop.
    a.  add a drop down menu into the companies component.  this drop down component will contain
        all the company_names in the company data.  When the customer name is selected by the user
        and the add button is clicked a new entry for that customer will be created in which the
        user can then insert a new site.
    b.  We need to amend the add function because the behaviour is different for how the generic
        add function behaves currently.  When a new site is created a corresponding record needs
        to be created with the same timestamp, customer_id and name.  This then needs to appear in
        table underneath the existing site.
    c.  This is going to break the logic of the existing syncCustomerName function.

4.  Think about authorisation.  How should this be implemented?  Should I render this in React myself
    using built-in hashlib libraries?  Are there other third party libraries/packages/services that 
    have been designed for this purpose?  Should the passwords be kept in the CRM database or in a
    separate database?

5.  Refactoring of the backend.

6.  Full review of the code.  Specifically the code located on the backend.
